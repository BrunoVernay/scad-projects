My OpenSCAD experimentations, 2D and 3D shapes.

[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is a very useful app to create 2D and 3D shapes from textual definitions. You can then export images, SVG for printing  or 3D formats for 3D printers.

It is way more usable than Inkscape or other drawing tools for some kind of work. **DSL rules!**


## Flexaedre "HyperQBS"

Comments are mostly in french in this one.
I made 2 versions: one simple in 2D.  

The 3D version is more experimental. I tried to (un)fold the shape reproducing real paper movements. While the concept is interesting, it requires more computations. I did it with one triangle, not sure I will continue for the others ...

Donc bref, 2 versions du flexahedre: une simple en 2D. Une experimentale construite en reproduisant le depliage en 3D (bien qu'int√©ressante conceptuellement ca demande trop de calcul).
